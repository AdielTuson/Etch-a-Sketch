# Etch-a-Sketch
In this project I will create something that is between an etch a Sketch
and a sketchpad. In this project I will mainly demonstrate the
manipulation of the DOM.


- problem 
I need to create a 16*16 grid layout of square divs. 

- plan
In order to do that I need to write a function that will create the divs
and append them to the greed container in the HTML. 
I will need to make sure that there are 16 divs in a row and 16 rows.
